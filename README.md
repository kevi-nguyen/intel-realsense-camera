# Intel RealSense Camera-Service
This repository contains a RESTful service designed to interface with an Intel RealSense camera. The service provides a GET /get_snapshot endpoint, which captures a frame from the cameraâ€™s colored video stream and returns it as a base64-encoded image. This allows for easy integration of real-time color image data into other applications without needing to handle complex image processing or camera interaction directly.
